#### Game Rules

The game is played with two players on a single screen.
Players take turns rolling a dice. The value of the dice is added to their current score.
If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0, and it becomes the next player's turn.
A player can choose to "Hold," which adds their current score to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points on their total score wins the game.
